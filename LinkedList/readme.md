## Problems of arr/ Need of Linked List

- Elements don't have to be in contigous memory locations in LinkedList but in stack they have to
- worst case insertion at end is Î¸(n) 
- Insertion in the middle (or beginning) is costly
- Deletion from the middle (or beginning) is costly
- Implementation of data struct. like queue and deque is complex with arrays
- Implementation of round robin scheduling is much less complex and cost-friendly with circular LL rather than arrays, since we will need to re-size our list of processes and also perform insertion at the end of list
- basically any problem where insertion at middle/end is performed more no of times, LL is better suited for them

## Questions on Singly LL

- [Linked List implementation](Singly_Linked_List/LL_basic)
    - Why do LL have self-referential struct? <br>
        every node needs to have addr of next node, and datatype of next node is same as the current node
- [LL Traversal](Singly_Linked_List/LL_traversal)
- [Insert at beginning of Singly LL](Singly_Linked_List/insert_at_begin.java)
- [Insert at end (tail) of Singly LL](Singly_Linked_List/insert_at_end.java)
- [Delete first node(head) in Singly LL](Singly_Linked_List/delete_first_node.java)
- [Delete last node(tail) in Singly LL](Singly_Linked_List/delete_last_node.java)
- [Insert at given position in Singly LL](Singly_Linked_List/insert_node.java)
- [Search in a LL(iterative & recursive)](Singly_Linked_List/SearchNode.java)
    - we can't do binary search in logn time on LL, since we can't find middle node in O(1) time
