# Notes/Ptrs

**How do you know it's a DP problem?**
- counting no of ways 
- minimum or maximum op in case of multiple ways 
- whenever concept of try all possible ways 

**Tips for developing recurrence relation**
- try to represent the problem in terms of index
- do all possible stuffs on that index according to PS
- if question says count all ways:
    - sum up all stuffs
- else if question says find min
    - take min(all stuffs)
