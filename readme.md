### Some resources and hacks 

- Cheatsheet for time and space complexity:
https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/


- The below tips are taken from [here](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns)

``` 

If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If must solve in-place then
    - Swap corresponding values
    - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

```
