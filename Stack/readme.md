## Stack
- is a linear DS that works like a box, i.e one end is closed 
- insertion operation is called push operation
- removal is called pop

## Operations on stack
- isEmpty() or empty(): return true if stack is empty, else false
- push(x): inserts an item to top of stack
- pop(): removes an item from the top
- peak() or top(): returns the top item
- size(): returns size of stack

## Corner conditions on stack

- underflow: when pop() or peek() function is called on empty stack
- overflow: when push called on a full stack

## Implementation

- [Array implementation of stack](array_stack.cpp)
